#BUG FIX - when you steal a word but people vote you down, the word you steal is still deleted
#BUG FIX - undo cannot bring back words that were deleted by the previous bug
#BUG FIX - when you steal a word and use tiles from the pool, those tiles aren't properly removed
#TODO - Lock other people out of drawing or saying words when voting is happening on one person's word
#TODO - two word melds into anagrams
#TODO - disconnect command
#TODO - show number of tiles remaining, game end logistics, scoring
#TODO - something to prevent other people for drawing for another player UNLESS we have to (timer runs out and they're afk, or we votekick them)
#TODO validate against names with asterisks or underscores or whatever fucky wucky stuff (quotes, backslashes - try to limit to letters and numbers). NO REPEAT NAMES
    #TODO prevent people having the same names
#TODO: You will probably never do this, but use a dictionary instead of whatever the fuck you have in there right now to preserve the relation between player names and nicknames'
#TODO: allow VIP to designate new VIP, make it so that it won't accept a draw from anyone except the person whose turn it is (OR VIP OVERRIDE)
    
#BUG FIX: Won't let you rearrange word in place (change WAYFAIR to FAIRWAY) - ONLY LET PEOPLE DO THIS FOR THEIR OWN WORDS, and don't make it jump to their turn to draw if it's just a rearrange
